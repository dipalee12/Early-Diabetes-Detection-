# Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset

## Overview
This dataset contains data related to the early stage risk prediction of diabetes. It includes various biomedical attributes such as glucose, insulin, age, and other clinical parameters. The goal is to predict whether a patient is at risk of developing diabetes at an early stage based on these attributes.

## Contents
- `diabetes_data.csv`: The main dataset file in CSV format.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the dataset.
